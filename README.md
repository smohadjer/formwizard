# formwizard
This is a prototype for a multi-step (and multi-substeps) localizable form built as a single page app. It addresses form initialization, re-population (from saved data), client-side validation, navigation (sequence-based or random), and the decision tree support. 

# Demo
- https://smohadjer.github.io/formwizard/index.html

# Requirements
- It should work even if javascript is disabled.
- It should work on IE11
- It should be possible to add/remove steps without changing 

# Features
- No use of jQuery or any 3rd party js/css frameworks.
- Client-side validation is done by [HTML5 validation attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation) and without javascript.
